## 🧠 About Me

I'm a **data-driven professional** who believes in building things that matter.  
Currently pursuing my **Master's at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC)**, I’m exploring the beautiful intersections of **Business Analytics**, **Data Engineering**, and **Consulting**.

My journey so far has been about **learning fast, building in public**, and **helping others level up** — whether it’s designing AI-powered tools, leading tech communities, or architecting smarter data solutions.

I like my data structured, my pipelines lean, and my dashboards sharp.  
🚀 Mission: **Solve real problems, share what I learn, and grow with the community.**
